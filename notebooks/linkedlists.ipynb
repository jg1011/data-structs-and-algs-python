    "Suppose we have a large collection of data that we regularly want to insert to. If we were to store this collection as an array we'd have to update all the indices upon each insertion, making it an $O(n)$ process. What if instead we were to the store the elements without indexing, but instead by pointing to the next element in the array. Then to insert all we'd have to do is update the pointer before our new item, and give our new item a pointer. This is $O(1)$, much better! Lets formalise this an study our new data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to update our elements as suggested. It is not sufficient to store only the data from each element, we need to point to the next element too. We'll call this a **node**. A linked list then simply contains a **head** node, which marks the start of the list. The head may (or may not) point to further nodes, but these need not be stored within the class itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider the ordered list $[1,2,3]$. We'd convert $1, 2, 3$ to nodes $N(1), N(2), N(3)$ and set $N(1)$ to have a pointer to $N(2)$, $N(2)$ to have a pointer to $N(3)$ and we may leave $N(3)$ with a null pointer as there are no further elements. The linked list would then just comprise of a head variable $N(1)$, which contains all the necessary information about the list (by chasing pointers if necessary). \n",

    "We implement as follows."

    "\n",
    "Notice how we had to add our elements in reverse order to obtain our [1,2,3] array. We'd like a way of doing this by adding 1, then 2, then 3. To do this we need an append function, which will be a little harder to implement. Naively, we may append by searching for the last element of the list and making it point to our new node. However the search portion of this approach is $O(n)$, bad! If we want to do this in $O(1)$ we can mark a **tail** (final) node in our list, and simply update this as we updated our head in the prepend method. This algorithm is as follows: \n",
    "- if arr is empty\n",
    "- set head = tail = new_node\n",

    "- end if\n",
    "- set tail.next = new_node \n",
    "- set tail = new_node\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't mark a tail we need to use our naive approach. To do so we'll loop through the list as in our to_arr method to find the tail and then update its pointer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most applications a tail is not specified, however in cases where an append method is regularly used it is worth allocating the extra space to mark the list's end. To incorporate a tail variable it requires updating each method to update / access the tail variable. I leave these implementations as exercises, which almost always amount to adding a special case or two, as all future algorithms will not use this tail. "
